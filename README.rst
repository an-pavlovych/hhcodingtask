The task
========

Summary
-------
Your task is to create a django model that would store any data (based on a given data configuration) and make this model usable across the project (admin integration + simple form view for adding new instances).

Requirements
------------
- django model, say `GenericModel`, that stores any data (proposed aproach is to use JSON field but we're open to better solutions)
- come up with a scheme describing data that `GenericModel` can store/process, for simplicity let's store it as a project-wide setting. Scheme can support only basic data types, like number, strings etc.
- view with form for end users for adding new instances of the `GenericModel` (with appropriate validation)
- django admin integration so admin can view/edit `GenericModel` instances

How to set up this project?
===========================
The project has been built using [cookiecutter-django template](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django). Please refer to it's docs for some more information. Launching the project follows well known guidelines of setting up a standard django project:

- creating virtualenv
- installing requirements
- running migrations
- running django dev server
